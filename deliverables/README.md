# Milestone 01

**Feedback:** Well done for a very good research proposal that addresses a real lime problem, the recognition of pedestrians whilst jaywalking. The hypothesis and research questions are good, yet some questions are difficult to test. The inspirational sources provided are sufficient to reassure the researcher that this research is possible. Kindly update the GIT repository to reflect your Milestone 01 deliverable. Well done.

**Grade:** 8/10
