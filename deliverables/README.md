# Milestone 01

**Feedback:** Well done for a very good research proposal that addresses a real lime problem, the recognition of pedestrians whilst jaywalking. The hypothesis and research questions are good, yet some questions are difficult to test. The inspirational sources provided are sufficient to reassure the researcher that this research is possible. Kindly update the GIT repository to reflect your Milestone 01 deliverable. Well done.

**Grade:** 8/10

# Milestone 02

**Feedback:** Well done for a very good literature review. The selected papers appear to be relevant and contribute well to your study. This review has identified well key aspects that are important to the micro-decision-making process needed such as hardware needed, datasets, possible solutions, evaluation metrics and evaluation results. Whilst no marks were reduced for the referencing style, kindly note that adherence to a proper style is expected for the final paper deliverable. The lack of a comparison table for datasets, algorithms and results makes it difficult to evaluate the research findings at a glance and thus is highly recommended for inclusion in future work. This review instils confidence that there is sufficient material to support the researcher in his study.

**Grade:** 11/15

# Milestone 03

**Feedback:** An overall good research methodology, yet the evaluation is not clearly explained. The pipeline can be presented better. Consider other experiments beyond just resizing.

**Grade:** 8/12
